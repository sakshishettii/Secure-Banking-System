Name: Sakshi Shetty

➛ Programming Language: Java

➛ Encryption/Decryption:

The project implements both public-key (RSA) and symmetric-key (AES) encryption methods for secure 
communication between the bank server and clients (ATMs). RSA is used for exchanging keys securely, 
and AES is used for encrypting sensitive user data.

➛ How to Execute the Program:

Compile: make compile
Run Bank Server: make run-bankserver
Run ATM Client: make run-atm
